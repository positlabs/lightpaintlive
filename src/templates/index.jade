					h1 light modes
					p Mercury has 4 modes for capturing light. Use the keys 0-3 to quickly switch modes.

					div(class='gif') gif

					div(class='buttons')
						button normal
						button average
						button lighten
						button darken

					div(class='descriptions')
						p normal: Used for fading the current painting.
						p average: Simulates traditional light painting.
						p lighten: Only captures the brightest light. Allows painting for a very long time without over-exposing the picture.
						p darken: Similar to lighten, but darkness is captured. Can be used in extremely bright environments.

				div(class='sub-section')
					h1 keyboard shortcuts
					p Mercury can be controlled remotely with a

				section(id='faq') 
					h1 Frequently asked questions

					h2 It's not working!
					p Make sure Chrome is up to date. Open chrome and go to 
						a(href='chrome://chrome' target='_blank') chrome://chrome 
						| to update.

					h2 How can I use a different webcam?
					p In Chrome, go to 
						a(href='chrome://settings/content' target='_blank') chrome://settings/content
						|, find the Media section, and select your camera.

					h2 Can I use a DSLR with LPL?
					p Yes, but it requires 3rd party software. Generally the video feed from DSLR to webcam is low resolution and low framerate. We don't recommend it.
					p #[a(href='http://sparkosoft.com/how-to-use-dslr-as-webcam' target='_blank') sparkosoft ]
					p #[a(href='http://extrawebcam.com/' target='_blank') extrawebcam]

					h2 Can I record light painting videos?
					p Yes, by using any screen-casting program. Quicktime has this feature built-in. There is also a free web-based program called 
						a(href='www.screencast-o-matic.com' target='_blank') screencast-o-matic.

					h2 How can I get rid of noise?
					p Most webcams default to using auto-exposure. This is not ideal for light painting. In complete darkness, 
						| it will use the maximum exposure, which makes the video very noisy (like high ISO). 
						| Use your webcam's driver software to control settings on the webcam, or use a universal webcam controller
						| like #[a(href='(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12)' target='_blank') Webcam Settings] (Mac).
					p Of course, the quality of the camera also affects this. We recommend Logitech webcams, like the #[a(href='http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/webcam-c930e-business' target='_blank') C930e]

					h2 How can I fade out my light painting?
					p Short fades are possible by switching modes; like 'screen' to 'normal'.
					p The formula below can be used to determine the duration of the fades. Each frame will subtract 1 from the current color, of which there are 256 possible values.
					p 256 (color values) / 60 (frames per second) = 4.3 seconds

					h2 Where can I buy light tools?
					p 
						a(href='http://lightpaintingbrushes.com/' target='_blank') LightPaintingBrushes. 
						span Jason Page's flexible, extensible light painting brush system. We highly recommend it. 
					p 
						a(href='http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytape/' target='_blank') Blinky Tape. 
						span Programmable 60-led RGB strips. Easy. 
					p Smartphones and tablets are also super cool. Get creative!




				section(id='open-source') 
					h1 open source
					p Here are some open source (free!) light painting programs. LPL doesn't actively maintain these projects, but hopefully they will serve you well.

				section(id='story') 
					h1 story
					p LPL started as a simple prototype. It had two buttons and was very slow. It was discovered by Joerg Miedza, 
						| a prominent member of the light-painting community. The app was very limited, but Miedza saw it as the next step 
						| in the evolution of light-painting. He wanted to know if it could be improved, so he emailed the developer. 
						| Ever since then, Josh and Joerg have been exchanging ideas and improving LPL. Joerg was overflowing with enthusiasm
						| and ideas. He was the driving force behind the LPL project. Without him, the program would still have only two controls!

					h3 Joerg Miedza: Artist
					p Joerg Miedza has been creating movies and photos using special techniques since the late 90's. 
						| He is the co-founder of the german light-art project LAPP-PRO. In this project, the LAPP-Team developed a 
						| unique brand of light painting: LightArt Performance Photography, or LAPP for short. The skills Miedza acquired
						| working with motion pictures allowed him to contribute significantly to the performance and artistic aspect of 
						| LAPP photography.
					p His personal work is at miedza.de 
					p There is also a book of the work: Painting With Light
					p Email: joerg@miedza.de 

					h3 Josh Beckwith: Developer
					p Josh has always been obsessed with science and technology - and as a child, he dreamed of becoming an inventor. 
						| Now, he's a senior interactive developer at Tool of North America.
