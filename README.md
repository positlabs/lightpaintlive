How can I fade out my light painting?
-----
Short fades are possible by switching modes. 

This formula can be used to determine the duration of the fades. 

256 (8-bit colors have 256 possible values) / FPS (frames per second. 60 or less.)

e.g. 256/60 = 4.3 seconds



It's not working!
-----
update chrome
open chrome and go to chrome://chrome

test the webcam (webrtc thing?)



Can I use a DSLR with LPL?
-----
Yes, but requires 3rd party software. Low framerate, low resolution. Not recommended. Use LPL to enhance your light painting, not replace it.
