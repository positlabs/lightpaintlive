FAQs

How can I fade out my light painting?
-----
Short fades are possible by switching modes. 

This formula can be used to determine the duration of the fades. 

256 (8-bit colors have 256 possible values) / FPS (frames per second. 60 or less.)

e.g. 256/60 = 4.3 seconds



It's not working!
-----
If the app isn't working, make sure Chrome is up to date. Open chrome and go to chrome://chrome to ask it to update itself.

Make sure the webcam is plugged in, and test to see if it works (https://apprtc.appspot.com). If it fails, then try updating the drivers for your webcam.



Can I use a DSLR with LPL?
-----
Yes, but it requires 3rd party software. Generally the video feed from DSLR to webcam is low resolution and low framerate. We do not recommend it.

How can I get rid of film noise?
-----
Most webcams default to using auto-exposure. This is not ideal for light painting. In complete darkness, it will use the maximum exposure, which makes the video very noisy. Use your webcam's driver software to control settings on the webcam, or use a universal webcam controller like Webcam Settings (Mac).
